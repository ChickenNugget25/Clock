# Clock

I have a class where the teacher splits up work and free time, so I made a python app to automate it. 

Green means free time, red means work time, white means the class hasn't started yet.

The times can be changed by changing the contents of the "reds.txt" file, in the following order:

{work time start} {work time end}, making sure each interval is on it's own line.

Also, you have to use military time,
so 1:00 should be inputted as 1300.

Example:

1135 1200
