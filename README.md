# Clock

I have a class where the teacher splits up work and free time, so I made a python app to automate it. 

Green means free time, red means work time

The times can be changed by changing the contents of the "reds.txt" file, in the following order:

{work time start} {work time end}, making sure each interval is on it's own line.

Example:

1135 1200
1207 1235
